            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all purpose | plain flour, (290 g | 10 oz)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar or sweetener, (60g | 2 oz)</li>
                <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 3/4 cups milk, (440ml)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup butter, (60g | 2 oz)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in<br>
                    a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted <br>
                    butter, vanilla and egg. </li>
                <li>Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them <br>
                    into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but<br>
                    that's okay).<br>
                    (The batter will be thick and creamy in consistency. If you find the batter too thick -- <br>
                    doesn't pour off the ladle or out of the measuring cup smoothly -- fold a couple tablespoons <br>
                    of extra milk into the batter at a time until reaching desired consistency).</li>
                <li>Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle. </li>
                <li>Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter<br> 
                    to lightly grease pan. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a <br>
                    round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.</li>
                <li>When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a <br>
                    spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
                <li>Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!</li>
            </ol>
